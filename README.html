<h1>CPSC 471 - Database Management - Group Project</h1>

<p>Group project for CPSC-471 Database Management</p>

<h2>Installing Frontend Dependencies</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Ensure npm version >=8.3.0 is installed on your machine. If it is not, follow the instructions found on <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">the official npm website</a>. You may also need to install Node.js, if you haven't done so previously. </p></li>
<li><p>Install yarn on your machine by following the instructions found <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable">on yarn's offical website</a>Note that this project was built using yarn version 1.22.17, so the legacy instructions are required. Following the instructions for yarn version >=2.0 <em>will not allow you to run the frontend.</em> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Only follow legacy instructions using npm.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Navigate to cpsc-471-project/frontend/ and run the command <code>yarn install</code>. If you haven't done this yet, it will read the existing <em>yarn.lock</em> file and install all the required dependencies automatically. It may take some time if this is your first time running the command. Be patient. </p></li>
<li><p>Follow the instructions in the section below to operate the development server</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Running the Server</h2>

<p><em>If you have not already installed the frontend dependencies (found in the previous section), you will need to do so before proceeding.</em></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Navigate to the directory <code>cpsc-471-project/frontend</code></p></li>
<li><p>In your command line, run the frontend server with the command <code>yarn run dev</code> . A live-reloading server hosting the website will be opened at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Please note that if you have "only HTTPS" set as a security protocol in your browser, you will not be able to access the development server without turning this setting off first.</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The server can be shut down with <code>CTRL+C</code> or the equivalent command for your command line. To restart the server, repeat the above steps. </p></li>
</ol>
